          partnerships. The game starts when everyone clicks the 'START GAME' button. Each round is
          90 seconds but the counter goes down to 10 seconds once everyone moves. You can change
          your move as many times as you want before the timer runs out.

          and so on.

          selfie alone, its like a regular selfie.

          times. You gain 10 followers. People can’t post mean comments but if anyone went live
