## About

The goal is to be one of the last two girls standing with followers left. Use the chat to
make strategic partnerships. The game starts when everyone clicks the 'START GAME' button.
Each round is 90 seconds but the counter goes down to 10 seconds once everyone moves. You
can change your move as many times as you want before the timer runs out. Three players
are needed to start the round. The last two players win and get 100 followers. Each girl
gets 10 followers for playing.

**Leave a Mean Comment.** If you Leave a Mean Comment on
another girl's social media, she loses 10 followers. It doesn't work if she selected
"Don't Post" that round.

**Dislike.** When you Dislike a girl's social media, she loses 20 followers per disliker. It only works if two or more girls both Dislike the same girl. If one girl Dislikes, no damage occurs to the target.

**Call iPhone.** Blocks what another girl tried to do that turn. She cannot Dislike, Leave a Mean Comment, or Go Live because you're distracting her.

**Go Live.** All girls will lose 30 points when you Go Live. If two girl's Go Live at the same time, they both lose 30 points. You get two Go Live's per game.

**Don't Post.** Nothing happens to you. Defense against Go Live and Mean Comments. If you Don't Post twice in a row, the second time you lose 10 followers if no one attacked you or went live.

**Post a Selfie.** Gives you twenty followers. If you Post a Selfie while someone is Going Live, there is no damage done to you. You get three selfies per game. It doesn't work if someone Calls your iPhone or Leaves a Mean Comment though, in which case you lose 0 and 20 followers, respectively, and are susceptible to Go Live damage.
